## What is going on???

I've wanted a website for a very long time. Today, I finally got one! I bought
the domain from Cloudflare, which may seem stupid given their recent
[outage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/), but in my
(uneducated) opinion, it's still a pretty good registrar. Also they sell
domains at-cost, so it's the cheapest it could possibly be. The SSL-by-default
was a huge plus too, because honestly I don't really understand how to set it
up myself.

## Why this domain?

I chose to get https://kaamkiya.dev for a bunch of reasons. I liked the idea
of a `.dev` domain, because honestly, it looks cool. And to me, `.com` feels
very generic and boring, and `.dev` stands out a little more. I chose to use
Kaamkiya because it's my username on a lot of platforms, including
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Kaamkiya) and
[Github](https://github.com/Kaamkiya).

## The Indie Web

The [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org) is a community whose goal is essentially
to get off the "corporate web", or things like Facebook. It aims for people to
write and own their own content, and control their web presences. This website
is kind of my own contribution to the Indie/Small Web.

## Misc

There's so much I can't wait to do with this!

Also, this is the first blog post of 2026. Wow, 2025 went by _fast_.
