## Depressing News

All the news I've seen or heard about recently has made me feel sad or
annoyed[^1] or angry. I haven't come across much happy news in the past while.

And I don't think it's just because I follow dark news. News about negative
things tends to just proliferate more[^2]. Humans have an innate fascination
with it. It really sucks, because big companies feed us what we read, and since
we read sad news, we get fed more of it to keep us reading. This has caused and
worsened real mental health problems in real people.

## Mainstream Media

I think that mainstream media should also start pushing some happy news,
instead of just sad things. It may be important to know what's happening in the
world, but not all of it is negative. We're just shown mostly negative things.

## Happy News

I'm going to start going out of my way to read about happy things as well,
because I know there is some out there. I'm also gonna start reading more small
blogs, because why not? The Indie Web[^3] is a real thing, and a lot of awesome
people write about a bunch on interesting topics.

## Conclusion

Mainstream media tends to be sad because that's the kind of content people tend
to consume. In my opinion, we should also try and find some happy news because
there definitely is some in the world and I want to know about it as well.

Thanks for reading!
