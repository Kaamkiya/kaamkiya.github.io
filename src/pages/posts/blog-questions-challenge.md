I read a bunch of other blog posts where people did this challenge, and I
figured I could too, so why not?

There are eight questions. Here goes nothing!

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I guess I wanted to share my thoughts with the world. I'm sure there's like
maybe one person who'll actually see this, but that's okay. My thoughts have
been noted down. I started in 2024 and I don't do it very often, but it's fun.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is I blog because I enjoy it.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build) for this. I originally wrote it as
static HTML but when I decided to add blog posts, I figured it would be nicer
to write them in Markdown. So I rewrote it in Astro and pulished a random old
blog post I'd made a long time ago.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Uhhh... no. I had Medium and Substack accounts at different times but never
really used them and published.

Oh actually, I used dev.to at one time. But that was years ago, and I feel like
the quality of that platform has deteriorated a lot, so I no longer use it.

## How do you write your posts?

In a Markdown file, using the [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com).

Here's a screenshot:

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

Not enough ðŸ˜­.

I don't have too many things that inspire me to write an entire blog post,
which you can easily tell by looking at my [list of posts](/blog). I get
inspiration from trends like this and whenever I find something really
interesting.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

Usually right after writing, and then I'll go through it after publishing to
edit it. Yes, after publishing. I don't know why but that's just how it is.

## Whatâ€™s your favourite post on your blog?

Easy question, as of this writing I literally only have two. It's the
[Tiny Transpiler](/posts/tiny-transpiler) post.

## Any future plans?

Write more, ideally. I'd like to publish a post per month or two. Maybe I'll
add more themes. I also want a page for post tags (like "trends" or "fun").

Oh, most importantly, a new domain. I'd like my own website instead of just
using Github pages.

## Whoâ€™s next?

I guess, if you read this and you have a blog, you should go do it!
