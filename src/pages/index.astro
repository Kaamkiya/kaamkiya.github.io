  <h4>Backend developer</h4>
  <p>
    I'm a backend developer who likes chocolate and terminals.
    <br />
    I have made many (mostly small) <a href="/projects">projects</a>, and
    they're almost all open for contributions, so if you'd like, feel free to
    help out!
    <br />
    I'm also currently looking for projects I can contribute to, so feel free to
    contact me with something.
