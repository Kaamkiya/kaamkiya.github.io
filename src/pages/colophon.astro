  <h4>How this website works, tech it uses, and more</h4>

  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  <p>
    This website is generated using
    <b><a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a></b>. It's written in JavaScript,
    and blog posts are in Markdown. Most of my Astro knowledge comes straight
    from the tutorial.
    <br />
  </p>

  <h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>
    The fonts used here are <code>JetBrains Mono</code> and Inter, but Inter
    falls back to your default system font, unless you have it installed on
    your computer.
  </p>

  <h3>Color palette</h3>
  <p>
    Colors used for dark mode are <code>1c1c1c</code> for the background,
    <code>e8e8e8</code> for the text, and <code>be99ff</code> for the accents,
    like links.
    <br />
    For light mode, the colors are <code>e8e8e8</code> for the background,
    <code>1c1c1c</code> for the foreground, and <code>6600dd</code> for
    accents.
  </p>

  <h3>Icons</h3>
  <p>
    I chose to use <a href="https://simpleicons.org/">Simple Icons</a>, since,
    well, they're simple. And I used
    <a href="https://www.astroicon.dev/">Astro Icon</a> to include icons,
    because it's a very easy way to incorporate icons into a website.
